      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Everything started when I was studying Math at the University of San Marcos, there were
        a lot of courses but the courses with which I felt passionate were Programming 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to say that since then I am passionate with technologies, I believe on the idea that
        technologies can make our world a better place, it makes sense for me because you can do
        whatever you want with code, also Google is doing it now, sharing information of everything
        in Colombia with people who have only traditional cellphones.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJPV2MZCFNU">Here is the video, if you are interested in.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am motivated to keep learning to be part of this technological transformation and make a social impact
        with those amazing technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I admire the philosophy of Richard Stallman in terms of sharing knowledge because I think that
        technology have to be accessible for everyone who wants to learn and have the passion to do it,
        that is why I have a blog, here you can see my <a href="https://awebablog.wordpress.com/">posts.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied in Laboratoria, there I learn how to be owner of my own learning and use the agile
        methodology in order to create products at the same time with a design thinking process, that help me to
        know that I can learn whatever technology I want and to create products that fits with the user needs
        and not only do it by the way I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        We simulate a work environment to implement sucessful and proficient projects,
        I invite you to see my projects in the that of My Projects.
